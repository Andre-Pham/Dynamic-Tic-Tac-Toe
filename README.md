# Dynamic-Tic-Tac-Toe
Tic-tac-toe game in which the computer plays the user and either draws or wins. The user decides how many columns, rows, and how many in a row to win, though processing is limited to a board with 20 spaces. Implements lexicographic permutation for computer decisions.

Supported on both Windows and MacOS. Note that this was built before I properly learnt to design software using OOP (and other practices), so the implementation may look a bit odd.

**Demos:**

A 3x3 and 3x6 game.

A 4x5 game, the largest board size. (Disclaimer: the program is very smooth and responsive, and it is only the gif that's low framerate)
